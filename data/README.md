# Put any data files in this folder

To create the data, run ```cd createData ``` followed by ```npm run install``` to download all the node dependencies. Then change ```fs.createReadStream('')``` to contain the csv file to be read. If the csv contains the new content, domain name, and the date, the script will generate a new csv that is compatable with the d3 code. Please note that when generating the files, the 100 most common words in English are omitted.
